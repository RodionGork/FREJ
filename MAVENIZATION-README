The mavenization process has kept the overal contents.

It has changed directory structure in accordance to the maven standards.

Besides, some ant task have been replaced by maven goals.
For instance:

* build: instead of "ant"

  mvn install
  
  o better
  
  mvn clean install
  
  it will create target/frej-1.158.jar


* clean: 

	mvn clean


* javadoc: instead of "ant doc" you must use:

  mvn javadoc:javadoc
  
  it creates api javadoc under target/apidocs
  
  mvn javadoc:jar
  
  it creates a jar archive, e.g. target/frej-1.1.58-javadoc.jar, containing the html pages
  
 
 * all: instead of "ant all"
 
   mvn install
   
   it will create both target/frej-1.1.58-javadoc.jar and target/frej-1.1.58.jar
   
   
 * demo: 
 
   mvn install -Pdemo
   
   it behaves like the previous 'mvn jar' but this time the target/frej-1.1.58.jar
    will contain the applet code and the test.html too
