<h1 id="syntax">Fuzzy Regexp Syntax</h1>

<p>
New Fuzzy Regular Expression is created by instantiation of frej.Regex class.
You need to pass "pattern" to constructor. This pattern describes what this
regular expression should match. Here rules of pattern syntax are explained.
</p>

<hr/>
<h3>Common principles</h3>  
<p>
Pattern consist of simple structural elements enclosed in brackets.
Elements usually are nested - in such case we say that "parent" element
encloses one or more "child" elements. There are six simple element types:

<ul>
<li><a href="#token">Token</a> should be matched by similar sequence of letters;</br>
<li><a href="#follow">Follow</a> element lists child elements which should be matched in proper order;</li>
<li><a href="#any">Any</a> element requires matching with any one of its children;</li>
<li><a href="#both">Both</a> element have two children and requirres match both of them either
in straight or reverse order;</li>
<li><a href="#optional">Optional</a> elment marks that its only child may be matched or skipped (which is better);</li>
<li><a href="#numeric">Numeric</a> matches integer in specified range;</li>
<li><a href="#regular">Regular</a> matches token with standard regexp.</li>
</ul>

Also two referencing element types are present: 

<ul>
<li><a href="#subexpr">Subexpr</a> is used to insert the same subexpression
into several places of main expression;</br>
<li><a href="#memory">Memory</a> matches token with result of earlier matched group.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
Additionally elements could specify substitution string for itself and
group capturing mark to use match or substitution result in outer elements.
This is thoroughly explained in <a href="subst">Grouping and Substitutions</a>.
</p>

<hr/>
<h3>Comments</h3>  
<p>In multiline patterns it is possible to use comments. Comment is started
with double-slash and ended with line-feed, carriage-return or pattern end.<br/>
<pre>[^frej,(?test)] //sample pattern</pre>
Look further for multi-line examples.
</p>

<hr/>
<h3>Pattern example</h3>  
<p>Here follows sample view of pattern which distinguishes between three
US presidents and provides some substitution for further processing.
</p>

<pre>
[^ //President recognizer
    (barack, {?h*}, obama)
        | 44-th,
    (= george, washington)
        | 1-st,
    ( {^ abraham, abe}, lincoln)
        | 16-th
]~A
    | $A_president_\rof_U\_S\_A
</pre>

<hr/>
<h3 id="subexpressions">Subexpressions</h3>  
<p>
Pattern could contain more than one expression - in this case all except first
are regarded as subexpressions. They should be marked with distinct names,
prefixed by double-colon and could be referenced with <a href="#subexpr">Subexpr</a> element:
</p>

<pre>
//main expression
[^
    {Baker,(@street)},
    {^Lenina,(@street)}],
    {^Piccadilly,(?(@street))}
]

//subexpression definition
::street
(^st,street,lane)
</pre>

<p>
References to subexpression should always precede definition of this subexpression in the pattern.
</p>

<hr/>
<h3>String processing</h3>
<p>
When {@link net.java.frej.Regex Regex} is instantiated and initialized by some pattern,
it is ready for using against text strings by using one of methods:
<ul>
<li>{@link net.java.frej.Regex#match match(String text)} - compares "text" with pattern,
supposing that pattern should fit "text" at whole;</li>
<li>{@link net.java.frej.Regex#matchFromStart matchFromStart(String text)} - compares
"text" with pattern, supposing that "text" possibly have extra tokens at the
end, i.e. is longer than pattern requires (unused tail could be fetched after
matching via {@link net.java.frej.Regex#suffix suffix()} method;</li>
<li>{@link net.java.frej.Regex#presentInSequence presentInSequence(String text)} -
searches in the "text" for a fragment, which is best match for pattern (unused
beginning and ending of the text could be fetched after matching via
{@link net.java.frej.Regex#prefix prefix()} and {@link net.java.frej.Regex#suffix suffix()} methods.
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Tokenization</b><br/>
When one of matching methods is called, text, which should be compared with
pattern, is broken up into separate tokens. All regexp elements, use the
input string as an array of tokens, and try to match one or more tokens from
this array. Tokens could be of following types:
<ul>
<li>sequence of letters;</li>
<li>sequence of digits;</li>
<li>punctuation mark;</li>
</ul>
Not all punctuation marks beget tokens - this could be set up by
{@link net.java.frej.Regex#setAllowedPunctuationMarks Regex.setAllowedPunctuationMarks(String marks)}.
Each of allowed punctuation marks creates separate token even if marks follow
each other. All other punctuation marks as well as spaces, linefeeds etc.
are regarded as token separators.</p>
<p>
For example, if we use (by default) "slash" and "dash" ('/' and '-') as
allowed punctuation marks and try to process the line <em>Baker street 221/B</em>
it is tokenized as [<em>Baker</em>, <em>st</em>, <em>221</em>, <em>/</em>, <em>B</em>].
</p>
<p>
If then we apply to this text pattern like <kbd>[ (^Baker,Taylor,Smith), st*, (#) ]</kbd>,
then <em>Baker</em> token would match Baker-Taylor-Smith choice (element <a href="any">Any</a>),
<em>street</em> would
match "st*" (element <a href="token">Token</a>) and <em>221</em> would match <a href="numeric">Numeric</a> element -
you see that these three elements (Any, Token and Numeric) are linked together by
outer brackets (i.e. <a href="follow">Follow</a> element) and because of this tokens which
would be matched by them should immediately follow one another.
</p>

<p><b>Result</b><br/>
Result of comparing text with pattern is evaluated as <b>double</b> value, which have meaning of
difference between text and pattern. Value of <b>0.0</b> means exact match. Result of matching complex
pattern against some text is evaluated by special rules explained below. All of matching methods
decide that matching is successfull if result is greater than <b>threshold</b> (which is initially
<b>0.34</b> and could be changed with help of {@link net.java.frej.Regex#setThreshold Regex.setThreshold(double)}.
</p>

<hr/>
<h3>Pattern characters, escapes and special symbols</h3>
<p>
All pattern elements except <a href="token">Token</a> are enclosed in brackets. To improve
readability three types of brackets are allowed - <b>(round), [square], and
{curly}</b>. There is no difference between them, though opening and closing
brackets of the element should be of one type. For example:
<ul>
<li><kbd>{ (^ Baker, Taylor, Smith ), st*, [#] }</kbd> is the same as a pattern above;</li>
<li><kbd>{[^Baker, Taylor, Smith],st*,(#)}</kbd> is the same too, (spaces
are skipped when processing pattern);</li>
<li><kbd>((^Baker, Taylor, Smith],st*,(#})</kbd> is incorrect because opening
and closing bracket types do not match.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
As it was mentioned, spaces, tabulations, line-feeds and carriage-returns
in the pattern are skipped. It allows more convenient formatting of patterns,
especially when specifying them in the file. Spaces are anyway token separators
by default so they are useless in pattern. However, if pattern provides
substitution strings, these strings could require spaces and other characters.
Special symbols could be used in such cases.
</p>

<p>
<b>Special symbols</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Space could be specified by using underscore: <b>(Baker,st)|Sherlock_Holmes</b> would
give substitution "Sherlock Holmes";</li>
<li>Underscores themselves could be specified by escaping them with backslash:
<b>(B\_a\_k\_e\_r,st)</b> would match "B_a_k_e_r st";</li>
<li>line-feed and carriage-return could be specified by <b>\n</b> and <b>\r</b>;</li>
<li>brackets could be specified by escaping them with backslash, i.e.
<b>\(</b>, <b>\)</b>, <b>\[</b>, <b>\]</b>, <b>\{</b>, <b>\}</b>;</li>
<li>round brackets could also be specified by <b>\o</b> and <b>\c</b> (opening
and closing respectively) to improve readability;</li>
<li>Backslash is specified by escaping it with another backslash <b>\\</b>.</li>
</ul>
</p>



<hr/>
<h1 id="elements">Element types description</h1>

<p>
Note: all elements except <a href="token">Token</a> are enclosed in brackets.<br/>Of those,
which needs brackets all except <a href="follow">Follow</a> have one-character type mark immediately after
opening bracket.<br/>
Elements which have several children should separate them with comma.
</p>

<hr/>
<h3 id="token">Token</h3>
<p>
This is the simplest element. It is specified by simple writing supposed token, as it should appear
in text, if it is written correctly. Special ability is that if token element has a star symbol <b>"*"</b> at
the end, it means that element may match only beginning of the token, skipping unused characters at end.
</p>
<p>
Token is matched in fuzzy way by calling {@link net.java.frej.fuzzy.Fuzzy#similarity Fuzzy.similarity(CharSequence text, CharSequence pattern)}.
</p>
<p>
<b>Result</b> of matching some token against "Token" element is the result returned by fuzzy matching method
and is roughly equal to count of mistakes divided by average between length of pattern and length of text.
Mistake is absence of symbol, extra symbol, replacement of one symbol with another and swap of two neighbor symbols.
</p>

<hr/>
<h3 id="follow">Follow</h3>
<p>
This element is constructed simply by enclosing some child elements in brackets:<br/>
<pre>( child1, child2, ..., childN )</pre>
tokens of text being matched should match each of child elements in the sequentially in the same order.
However if among child elements (or their children) there are "Optional" element, it (according to its design)
could be skipped. For example <kbd>(apple, beats, (?clean), dust)</kbd>:
<ul>
<li>matches <em>aple bets claen duust</em>;</li>
<li>matches <em>appl beatz dust</em>;</li>
<li>does not match <em>appl never beatz dust</em>;</li>
<li>does not match <em>appl beatz wet dust</em>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>Result</b> of matching sequence of tokens against "Follow" element is such that:<br/>
- if any child yields result of <b>1.0</b> or greater, total result is <b>1.0</b>;<br/>
- if all children yield the same result <b>X</b>, total result is equal to this value;<br/>
- total result is between best and worst of children results.<br/>
These rules have some "corrective" behavior - for example if one child gives result of <b>0.5</b> and other
of <b>0.0</b> then their total would be close to <b>0.3</b> - i.e. if some child fits very well, some other
is allowed to fit more poorly if when matched alone.
</p>
<p>
Exact rule of result evaluation is the following (similar to geometric mean):<br/>
<b>E<sub>total</sub> = 1 - ( (1 - E<sub>1</sub>) * (1 - E<sub>1</sub>) * ... * (1 - E<sub>N</sub>) )<sup>1/N</sup></b><br/>
where E<sub>i</sub> is the result of matching i-th child (truncated to 1.0 if it was greater).
</p>
<p>
Result evaluation became complicated if "Optional" element exists among children. In this case results
for two variants are compared - including this skippable part and excluding it - and then best is chosen.
</p>

<hr/>
<h3 id="any">Any</h3>
<p>
This element is constructed by enclosing some children in brackets and putting "<b>^</b>" mark immediately
after opening bracket:<br/>
<pre>(^ child1, child2, ..., childN )</pre>
each of children is tested against the same tokens and best matching children is chosen.
If child elements contain substitution strings, then one of them would be returned as substitution for
parent element, depending on which child was matched
For example <kbd>(apple|Jane, (banana, tree)|Mike, pear|Liza)</kbd>:
<ul>
<li>matches and converts <em>aple</em> to <em>Jane</em>;</li>
<li>matches and converts <em>bonano three</em> to <em>Mike</em>;</li>
<li>does not match <em>pear tree</em> (and returns nothing for substitution);</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>Result</b> of matching against "Any" is equal to result of chosen child (i.e. best of child results).
</p>
<p>
When "Any" could be matched in several ways with the same result (for example if there is "Optional" among
subchildren), then longest variant is selected (i.e. one, which grabs more tokens than others).
</p>

<hr/>
<h3 id="both">Both</h3>
<p>
This element is constructed by enclosing exactly two children in brackets and putting "<b>=</b>" mark
immediately after opening bracket:<br/>
<pre>(= child1, child2 )</pre>
both children should be matched with tokens of input text sequentially, but in any order.
</p>
<p>
I.e. <kbd>(=A,B)</kbd> equals <kbd>(^(A,B),(B,A))</kbd> and is evaluated and substituted just in this manner.
</p>

<hr/>
<h3 id="optional">Optional</h3>
<p>
This element is constructed by enclosing other element (i.e. the only child) in brackets and putting "<b>?</b>" mark immediately
after opening bracket:<br/>
<pre>(? child)</pre>
It is usable only inside other elements (like "Follow" or "Both"), where it allows some of children to be
skipped, if this give better match result.
</p>
<p>
In cases when child element is not <a href="#token">Token</a> an alternative short syntax
is allowed. Instead of writing, for example:
<pre>
(?(^child1,child2))
(?(#M:N))
(?($X))
</pre>
it is possible simply omit brackets around Optional's child:
<pre>
(?^child1,child2)
(?#M:N)
(?$X)
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<b>Result</b> is equal to result of child element, if it was not skipped. Otherwise result is not counted
(i.e. if "Follow" element have <b>N</b> children and one of them was "Optional", and was skipped, then
result of "Follow" is evaluated as if consisting of N-1 elements only).
</p>

<hr/>
<h3 id="numeric">Numeric</h3>
<p>
This element is constructed by putting "<b>#</b>" mark immediately
after opening bracket and optionally specifying range of number to be matched.
<ul>
<li><kbd>(#)</kbd> - mathces any token which represents <b>integer</b> value;</li>
<li><kbd>(#N)</kbd> - matches only if integer is between <b>1</b> and <b>N</b> inclusively;</li>
<li><kbd>(#M:N)</kbd> - matches only if integer is between <b>M</b> and <b>N</b> inclusively.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>Result</b> is equal to <b>0.0</b> if token is numeric and fits in specified range. Otherwise
result is equal to <b>1.0</b>
</p>
<p>
Such element type is convenient because it is usually not good idea to match numbers in fuzzy way,
but often is important to check the range of number (when applied to enumerated floors, avenues,
departments etc.)
</p>

<hr/>
<h3 id="regular">Regular</h3>
<p>
This element is constructed by putting "<b>!</b>" (exclamation mark) immediately after opening
bracket and specifying standard regular expression after it. Some special symbols should be
escaped. Regular expression have syntax as described in <b>java.util.regex.Pattern</b> and matches the
token using <b>String.matches(String regex)</b>. Example:<br/>
<pre>(!\[A-Za-z\]\{3\})</pre>
matches token consisting of exactly 3 latin letters (like <em>IBM</em> or <em>NaN</em>).
</p>
<p>
<b>Result</b> is equal to <b>0.0</b> if token matches specified expression. Otherwise
result is equal to <b>1.0</b>
</p>

<hr/>
<h3 id="subexpr">Subexpr</h3>
<p>
This element is constructed by putting "<b>@</b>" immediately after opening bracket and then specifying
exact name of subexpression defined in the pattern (definition should be plased later in the pattern,
not earlier). See <a href="#subexpressions">subexpressions</a> for an example of usage and of
definition subexpressions themselves.
</p>
<p>
<b>Result</b> is just equal to result returned by subexpression.
</p>

<hr/>
<h3 id="memory">Memory</h3>
<p>
This element is constructed by putting "<b>$</b>" immediately after opening bracket and then specifying
the name which identifies some of marked <a href="#group">groups</a>.<br/>
<pre>((^white|black,red|cyan,green|magenta,blue|yellow)~COLOR,and,($COLOR))</pre>
Would match if pair of complementary colors specified, i.e. <em>white and black</em> or <em>blue yellow</em>.
This element have sense mostly for complex substitutions.
</p>
<p>
<b>Result</b> is evaluated as if <a href="token">Token</a> is matched using as a pattern the string,
returned by previously
matched group. I.e. if in our example <em>red</em> was matched and substituted with <em>cyan</em> in
a group <b>A</b>, then memory element being matched against <em>cian</em> would return <b>0.25</b>.
</p>

<hr/>
<h1 id="subst">Grouping and Substitutions</h1>

<p>
Any pattern element could be followed by <b>substitution string</b> or
<b>grouping mark</b> (or both, in the same order).
</p>

<h3 id="group">Grouping mark</h3>
<p>
Grouping is specified with "tilda" following name consisting of letters
and digits.
This makes engine remember the replacement result of the element (which now
could be regarded as "group") in table of groups, so it could be later used
in other matches or replacements.
</p>
<p>
Example of grouping marks usage (with no special purpose):
<pre>[ (^Anna, Bill, Dave)~NAME, (^Johnson, Smith)~LAST ]</pre>
</p>

<h3>Substitution string</h3>
<p>
For any element after it was matched, "replacement" or "substitution" could
be retrieved. Normally for <a href="token">Tokens</a> replacement equals to token pattern (if
pattern have no "*" at end). In all other cases replacement equals to matched
token of the text. For parent elements replacement is concatenation of children
replacements.
</p>
<p>
For example if <kbd>(Anna, J*)</kbd> is matched against <em>anne Jackson</em>
the replacement is equal to <em>AnnaJackson</em>. 
</p>
<p>
Any element could specify other replacement than default with help of pipe
symbol <b>"|"</b> after which replacement string follows. For example:
<pre>(Anna, J*|Wilson)</pre>
Now <em>anne Jackson</em> and <em>Ann Johnson</em> would have replacement
<em>"AnnaWilson"</em>
</p>
<p>
Replacement string could include references to previously matched groups,
specifying this with dollar sign <b>$</b> followed by group name which
is enclosed in brackets preceding dollar sign. Brackets could be omitted if
name consist of only one character.
In this case result of replacement of specified group would be inserted into
replacement string:
<pre>[(^Anna, Elisa, Jessica|Jess)~A,(^Dowson,Jackson)~SURNAME] | Is_not_$A_($SURNAME)_beautiful?</pre>
<em>Ann Douson</em> => <em>Is not Anna Dowson beautiful?</em><br/>
<em>Jessica Iakson</em> => <em>Is not Jess Jackson beautiful?</em><br/>
<em>William Wilson</em> => <i>(nothing)</i>
</p>
<p>There are three other useful referencing marks:
<ul>
<li><b>$$</b> inserts matched token (useful with <a href="token">Token</a> element because it
gives not matched token but pattern itself as replacement by default)</li>
<li><b>$&lt;</b> inserts {@link net.java.frej.Regex#prefix() prefix} - useful in
top-level expression when matching with
{@link net.java.frej.Regex#presentInSequence(String text) presentInSequence};</li>
<li><b>$&gt;</b> inserts {@link net.java.frej.Regex#prefix() prefix} - useful in
top-level expression when matching with
{@link net.java.frej.Regex#presentInSequence(String text) presentInSequence} or
{@link net.java.frej.Regex#matchFromStart(String text) matchFromStart};</li>
</ul>
</p>
